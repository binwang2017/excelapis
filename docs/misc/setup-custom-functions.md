# Setup

These instructions will let you set up your computer to preview custom functions in Excel. You'll need a Windows PC for now - the preview hasn't been released for Mac or other platforms yet.

## Office Insider Program
Join the [Office Insider program](https://products.office.com/en-us/office-insider?tab=Windows-Desktop) to install the version of Excel 2016 that's required for custom functions on your computer (must also be version 16.8711 or later). You must choose the "Insider" channel for the custom functions preview to work.
